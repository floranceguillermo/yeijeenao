Hello, I made a rather large update of about 30 packages to my Kubuntu install and I then discovered my audio device (USB connected DAC) is no longer seen under lsub or "aplay -l".

I should probably say I started with a Kali-Light iso booted on a USB drive. Some commands weren't working, like killall, so I thought I need to download the full packages.

Heya everyone, I'm a Debian stable user for some time and everything looks kind of. old, so I want to move to Debian Unstable. First I wanted to go to Testing then I found out Unstable is actually better than testing so. How would it work as my daily driver? How stable it actually. I recently switched cards from an old NVIDIA to an AMD RX 580. I am on Ubuntu 18.10 and it supposedly has Mesa drivers installed and ready to use. The thing is, all the games run really slow, or consume a lot of RAM so I run out of it before loading, or just use the CPU like a Thread-ripper running with an FX clock at full speed. The OS is obviously not using the card at even a decent potential. At first, I had a generic driver and then proceeded to install a drivers package from the padoka. 
I have a headless Ubuntu 14.04 server hosted by Kimsufi that I use as a media server. When I setup the server a year ago, I used the Ubuntu image they provide to get up and running faster. Plex just released a build of their server with hardware en/decoding on intel devices with QSV. My server has an i5-3570S running on an Intel DH61AG motherboard. I can not get hardware encoding and decoding to work - plex says there is no supported device. When I run: gt lspci I was just banned this morning, for what I initially suspected was simply a fresh false detection of WINE use.

I happened to have it installed as a dependency of GNS3, but I have not actually used GNS3 on this system since I installed it and I have never used xdotool otherwise. xdotool was not even running when I checked Hello, I am working on some docker stuff and i noticed that on my mac i cannot access this path /var/lib/docker/volumes/.

Hey guys, I'm trying to install a GameCube controller (The black Smash Wii U one) along with the Wii U Adapter. However, when I run Zadig, I encounter issues.

UPDATE : Everyone was correct, I should not have tried to enable the driver `amdgpu-pro`. After removing it, I found that I was missing the 32bit version of `libvulkan1:i386`. This missing library was creating the error “wine: Call from 0x7bc77779 to unimplemented function vulkan-1.dll.vkGetInstanceProcAddr, aborting” that was resolved after installing the library. As many said, the correct driver was reported as `AMD RADV` after this library was installed. There are still errors.

Hi there. I've been a mint user for some months now, I use mainly for programming because school. But i miss playing games, I know that steam has the compatibility stuff with proton, but when i try to run ANY game, CSGO for example, it's like I'm watching a stop motion movie, it's unplayable So i've been getting this BSOD this week, i already looked up for fixes. I already test my RAM using the windows memory tool, updated my drivers, still no fix. The one thing I think may be causing this is my OC'ed CPU, however im using this OC for a year and i didnt get any BSOD. Im using i5-6600k OC'ed @ 4.5ghz 1.33v. Ive uploaded the dump files here https://www.mediafire.com/file/4eseekkbh9pkgfn/New_folder.zip/file. 
Hello, I installed Debian testing to my laptop few days ago. I installed Steam and it worked fine (did'nt try or download any games yet, I only opened it and logged in). Didn't use laptop after this for 2 days. Now Steam doesn't open anymore. When I open Steam it checks updates, it's connecting to my account but after that nothing. I haven't installed any drivers yet, the laptop has Geforce 150MX. The only thing I did between working Steam and broken steam was that I ran the command apt-get.
